# üõ°Ô∏è Linux Host Hardening Lab

## üéØ Objective

Implement practical hardening controls on a Linux host to reduce attack surface and improve resilience against common threats (unauthorized access, privilege escalation, insecure services, weak configuration).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Lab Setup

Prepare a disposable lab VM (Ubuntu/Debian recommended). Create a working directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/labs/hardening && cd ~/labs/hardening
```

(Optional) Instructors may provide sample vulnerable configurations for students to remediate: weak SSH config, world-writable file, weak sudoers entry, open firewall rule, or a test user without 2FA.

---

## üß© Stage 1 ‚Äî Baseline Discovery & Inventory

**Goal:** Discover current system state and identify insecure defaults or services.

**Tasks**

* Enumerate running services and open ports.
* List installed packages and versions.
* Identify active user accounts and groups.
* Check SSH configuration and login-related settings.

**Hints**

* `ss`, `netstat`, `systemctl`, `ps aux`, `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`, `sudo -l`, `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

---

## üß© Stage 2 ‚Äî Authentication Hardening

**Goal:** Strengthen user authentication and access controls.

**Tasks**

* Disable password authentication for SSH; require keys and/or 2FA.
* Enforce password complexity and expiration policies.
* Remove or lock unused user accounts; restrict sudoers.
* Configure and test SSH key-based login for a test user.

**Hints**

* `/etc/pam.d/common-password`, `chage`, `/etc/login.defs`, `sshd_config` (`PasswordAuthentication no`, `PermitRootLogin no`)

---

## üß© Stage 3 ‚Äî Service & Package Hardening

**Goal:** Minimize running services and ensure packages are updated and configured securely.

**Tasks**

* Disable or remove unneeded services.
* Apply system updates and check for missing security patches.
* Configure services with least privilege and secure defaults.
* Identify and remove unnecessary packages.

**Hints**

* `apt update && apt upgrade` or equivalent, `systemctl disable --now <service>`, `dpkg -l` or `rpm -qa`

---

## üß© Stage 4 ‚Äî Filesystem & Permissions Hardening

**Goal:** Fix risky file and directory permissions and protect sensitive files.

**Tasks**

* Find and remediate world-writable files outside expected directories.
* Ensure critical files have correct ownership/permissions.
* Consider mounting sensitive directories with restrictive options (noexec, nodev, nosuid).

**Hints**

* `find / -xdev -type f -perm -o+w`, `stat`, `ls -l`, `/etc/fstab`

---

## üß© Stage 5 ‚Äî Logging, Monitoring & Auditing

**Goal:** Ensure the system records security-relevant events and alerts are possible.

**Tasks**

* Confirm syslog/rsyslog/journald is running and storing logs.
* Enable auditing for critical files and commands (auditd).
* Configure log rotation and remote log forwarding (optional).
* Create a simple alert for critical changes.

**Hints**

* `systemctl status rsyslog`, `journalctl`, `auditctl -l`, `ausearch`, `/etc/logrotate.d/`

---

## üß© Stage 6 ‚Äî Network Hardening & Firewall

**Goal:** Limit network exposure using host-based firewall and secure network services.

**Tasks**

* Implement firewall rules allowing only required ports/services.
* Block inbound traffic by default and create explicit allow rules.
* Harden SSH (rate-limiting, non-standard port optional, fail2ban).
* Verify firewall rules persist across reboots.

**Hints**

* `ufw`, `iptables`, `nft`, `ufw default deny incoming`, `ufw allow ssh`, `fail2ban`

---

## üß© Stage 7 ‚Äî Secure Bootstrapping & Patch Management

**Goal:** Implement or describe a patching and baseline hardening process.

**Tasks**

* Create a simple patching plan (frequency, testing, rollback).
* Implement automated updates for critical security patches (or justify why not).
* Create a baseline hardening script or configuration snapshot.

**Hints**

* `unattended-upgrades`, snapshots, idempotent scripts/checklists

---

## üß© Stage 8 ‚Äî Least Privilege & Application Sandboxing

**Goal:** Reduce privileges for services and sandbox apps where possible.

**Tasks**

* Run services under dedicated, unprivileged users.
* Apply AppArmor/SELinux profiles or describe policy.
* Use chroot, namespaces, or containers for isolating risky applications.

**Hints**

* Check systemd service `User=` directives, `aa-status`, `sestatus`

---

## üß© Stage 9 ‚Äî Validation & Hardening Verification

**Goal:** Validate the applied hardening and produce a short verification checklist.

**Tasks**

* Re-scan the host for open ports and services; verify changes.
* Validate permissions and that unauthorized logins fail.
* Produce an evidence log summarizing applied changes and verification results.

**Hints**

* Repeat Stage 1 commands to compare pre/post states.
* Capture outputs (screenshots or terminal logs) for documentation.

---

## üß† Expected Learning Outcomes

* Discover insecure defaults and reduce attack surface on a Linux host.
* Configure SSH, firewall, package management, logging, and permissions securely.
* Understand trade-offs (availability vs security) and verify hardening changes.

---

## Instructor Notes / Safety

* Use a disposable VM or snapshot; avoid production changes.
* Include rollback steps when modifying SSH or firewall.
